# Generate a broad range of solutions to a small challenge
This short format workshop is useful when a team has a narrowly scoped challenge but a number of stakeholders with different ideas on how to solve it. By bringing together a cross-functional (UX, ENG, Product) group the team can align more quickly on the best solutions to pursue and quickly expand the potential solutions available for testing.
